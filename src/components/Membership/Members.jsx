                            During the PMI® Membership renewal or registration process, a chapter with the nearest geo-location/IP address will be conveniently assigned to you. Before completing your purchase, confirm your preferred chapter has been assigned. If you'd like to change 
                            it, simply choose another PMI chapter in India that aligns with your professional and networking interests.

                            I believe that making chapter membership more accessible will improve the PMI® Membership experience for all project professionals in India.
